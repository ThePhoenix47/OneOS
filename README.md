PhoenixOS
==
This is a ComputerCraft Operating System based on popular OneOS by oeed, which sadly is no longer developed.
This OS is especcially focussed on mobile compatibility and RedNet Hacking/Sniffing. It features many useful
tools for sniffing messages, taking over other Users' networks and even use them against their creators.
This is based on latest stable OneOS version v1.3.4. All Credits for this belong to oeed.

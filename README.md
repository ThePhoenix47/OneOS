PhoenixOS
==
Remark: This is a fork I created a few years ago mainly to have a personal OS I can easily install on servers... do not expect this to be maintained and/or updated. It is basically just a collection of freely available tools and OneOS. Don't judge me by this.

This is a ComputerCraft Operating System based on popular OneOS by oeed, which sadly is no longer developed.
This OS is especcially focussed on mobile compatibility and RedNet Hacking/Sniffing. It features many useful
tools for sniffing messages, taking over other Users' networks and even use them against their creators.
This is based on latest stable OneOS version v1.3.4. All Credits for this belong to oeed.
